<h1> Netflix - Clone </h1>
I build a front-end Netflix clone with a Firebase back-end! I used the TMDB API for all of the data AND I will be using Firebase Authentication to give login functionality. I will be able to store user specific data with a React front-end and a Firebase back-end. I have used Firestore which is cloud storage with Firebase to save data. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS - an incredible CSS framework. 

Further more, I am going to include Redux Store, Redux form and Redux saga for more functionality.
